## Overview

Welcome to HCMUT_SSPS – the HCMUT Student Smart Printing Service, a platform designed to simplify document printing for students across our campuses. Our system features  located printers, each uniquely identified, and offers a seamless printing experience.

Students can  upload files, choose printers, and customize printing options. The system logs all printing activities, ensuring transparency and accountability. Students receive default A4-size pages per semester, with the option to purchase more through online payment.

Managed by the Student Printing Service Officer (SPSO), the system allows administrative control over printers and configurations. Users authenticate via the HCMUT Single Sign-On (SSO) service for secure access.

Accessible via website, HCMUT_SSPS provides a user-friendly interface for reviewing printing history and generating monthly/yearly reports.
